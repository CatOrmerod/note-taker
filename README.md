## Tools & Technologies
---
    * Front end code was provided which included the HTML pages, and accompanying files of js and css.  Bootstrap and JQuery were utilised in these files.  
    * Backend files were created utilising Express and Node.js.
    * A unique id was required for the database file so I used Get Date to produce a unique number that could then be used as an associated id.
    * The id then enabled me to use the delete button that was available.  

## Installation
---
You can view the project on [Heroku](https://obscure-cove-73558.herokuapp.com/) or alternatively on my github repo (link below).  
To do this you will need to clone repository, open the server file in integrated terminal and enter 'npm i' to install dependancies.  From there you can run 'node server.js' in terminal before opening localhost:8080 in your browser.
